Subject: Your Complete Digital Audit & AI Search Optimization Report - Reignite Health

Hi Liam,

I've completed a comprehensive digital audit of reignitehealth.com.au and I'm excited to share the findings with you.

This isn't a typical website review. I've analyzed your site from three critical angles:

1. TRADITIONAL SEO & UX
   - Technical performance analysis
   - User experience and conversion optimization
   - On-page SEO and content structure

2. AI SEARCH VISIBILITY (The New Frontier)
   - How ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Perplexity describe your business
   - Citation gaps costing you AI-driven traffic
   - Strategies to become THE recommended answer

3. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
   - How you stack up against The Physio Co, Vista Healthcare, and Active Living
   - Content gaps they're exploiting
   - Quick wins to leapfrog the competition

THE GOOD NEWS:
- Your niche focus on retirement villages is unique and powerful
- "We put life in your years" is memorable branding
- Your modern website design is better than most competitors
- Your security setup is excellent (SSL, HSTS, Cloudflare)

THE OPPORTUNITIES:
- Your site is currently invisible to AI search systems (quick fix available)
- No XML sitemap means search engines can't properly index your pages
- Missing schema markup that would help Google understand your services
- No Google Business Profile - you're missing from local search results

WHAT'S INSIDE THE REPORT:
- Executive summary with priority scores
- Technical audit with specific fixes
- AI search reality check (what AI actually says about you)
- Competitor analysis matrix
- Ready-to-implement schema markup (just copy & paste)
- Optimized meta tags for every page
- Content briefs for recommended new pages
- Implementation roadmap with priorities

I've prioritized everything so you know exactly what to tackle first for maximum impact.

The most critical issue? Your robots.txt is blocking AI crawlers (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity). This is a 5-minute fix that will immediately start building your AI visibility.

Want to discuss the findings? I'm happy to jump on a quick call to walk through the highlights and answer any questions.

Best regards,
