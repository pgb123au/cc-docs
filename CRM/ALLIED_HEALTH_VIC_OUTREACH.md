## EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Email 1: The Problem/Solution Hook (Cold Outreach)

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: "Your receptionist called in sick - now what?"
- B: "The call you missed at 5:47pm yesterday"
- C: "[Practice Name] - quick question about your phones"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: what happens to the calls that come in when your team is busy with patients, at lunch, or after 5pm?

For most allied health practices, the honest answer is... they go to voicemail. And voicemails often mean lost bookings.

We've just helped Reignite Health (allied health provider across 10 aged care villages) solve this with an AI receptionist that:

- Answers every call 24/7 in a natural voice
- Books directly into Cliniko in real-time
- Handles DVA, HCP, Medicare & NDIS funding queries
- Speaks 30+ languages for diverse patient bases

The result? No more missed calls. No more voicemail phone tag. Appointments just appear in Cliniko.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this could work for [Practice Name]? No pitch, just a quick demo so you can hear it yourself.

### Email 2: The Case Study Email (Follow-up or warm lead)

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: "How 877 patients now book appointments without waiting on hold"
- B: "Allied health practice cuts phone admin by 70%"
- C: "Case study: AI receptionist for Cliniko practices"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share something that might be relevant for [Practice Name].

We recently completed an AI voice receptionist implementation for Reignite Health, an allied health provider serving aged care residents across Sydney and the Central Coast.

The challenge:
- High call volume overwhelming reception
- Multiple funding types (DVA, HCP, Medicare, NDIS, private)
- Calls going to voicemail after hours and during peak times
- Staff spending hours on routine booking calls

The solution:
An AI receptionist that integrates directly with Cliniko to answer calls 24/7, check real-time availability, and create bookings with all the correct appointment notes.

Key stats:
- 10 villages served
- 877+ patients in the system
- 26 different service types
- 80+ features built into the AI
- 2,000+ classes booked per year

The AI handles everything from "I'd like to book a physio appointment" to "I'm a DVA patient, my claim number is..."—and the booking appears in Cliniko with all details attached.

Worth a 15-minute look?

I'd be happy to show you how it sounds and answer any questions. No obligation, just a quick demo.

### Email 3: The Direct/Busy Person Email (Short & punchy)

**Subject:** AI receptionist for Cliniko - 15 min demo?

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

We build AI receptionists that integrate with Cliniko.

What it does:
- Answers calls 24/7
- Books appointments in real-time
- Handles DVA/HCP/Medicare/NDIS funding
- Sounds natural (not robotic)

Just helped Reignite Health (10 villages, 877 patients) go live.

Worth a 15-minute demo?

### Email 4: The "After Hours" Hook

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "What happens when a patient calls at 7pm?"
- B: "The after-hours problem every practice has"
- C: "Your voicemail is costing you bookings"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Did you know 23% of healthcare appointment requests come outside business hours?

That's according to industry data - and if your practice goes to voicemail after 5pm, you're almost certainly losing bookings to competitors who answer.

We solved this for Reignite Health with an AI receptionist that:

- Answers every call, 24/7/365
- Books into Cliniko in real-time (no "message taken, we'll call you back")
- Handles complex queries - Medicare referrals, NDIS funding, HCP claims
- Sounds completely natural (patients rarely realise it's AI)

Their result: Zero missed calls. Appointments appearing overnight. Staff arriving to a full schedule instead of a voicemail queue.

Curious what this would look like for [Practice Name]?

### Email 5: The Funding Complexity Email

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "DVA, HCP, Medicare, NDIS, Private - all handled automatically"
- B: "Stop explaining funding types to your receptionist"
- C: "The hardest part of allied health reception - solved"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

The hardest thing about training a receptionist in allied health?

It's not the booking system. It's explaining the difference between DVA white cards, HCP packages, NDIS plan-managed vs self-managed, Medicare Enhanced Primary Care referrals, and when to ask for a claim number vs a package number.

Our AI already knows all of this.

When a patient calls and says "I'm on a home care package through Baptist Care and I need to see the physio," the AI:

1. Verifies HCP funding eligibility
2. Checks the patient's approved services
3. Finds the next available physio slot
4. Books directly into Cliniko
5. Adds all the right notes for billing

No training required. No mistakes. No "can I put you on hold while I check?"

This is what we built for Reignite Health (10 villages, 877 patients, all funding types).

Want to see how it works?

### Email 6: The "Reception Stress" Email

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "When your receptionist is also your bottleneck"
- B: "Patients on hold. Patients at the counter. Phone ringing."
- C: "The reception problem nobody talks about"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

You know the scene:

Phone ringing. Patient at the counter trying to pay. Another patient asking about their next appointment. Someone's running late and needs to reschedule. And another call just went to voicemail.

Your receptionist is doing their best, but they're only one person.

Here's a different approach:

An AI that handles every phone call instantly - booking appointments, answering questions, checking availability - so your receptionist can focus on the patients physically in front of them.

It's what Reignite Health did across their 10 villages. The AI now handles:
- 877+ patients across 26 service types
- Medicare, NDIS, DVA, HCP, and private billing questions
- Appointment booking, rescheduling, and cancellations
- 24/7 coverage (including after hours and weekends)

The result? Reception can actually focus. No more phone tag. No more "sorry, can I put you on hold?"

Worth a look?

### Email 7: The ROI/Numbers Email

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "The math on AI reception (it's cheaper than you think)"
- B: "What does a missed call actually cost you?"
- C: "30% cost reduction - here's how"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick math:

Average initial physio consultation: $85-120
Average patient lifetime value: $500-2,000+
Estimated calls that go to voicemail and don't return: 30-50%

If your practice misses 5 calls per week that would have booked... that's $2,500-10,000+ in potential revenue. Every month.

Now compare that to an AI receptionist that:
- Costs a fraction of a full-time hire
- Never calls in sick
- Works 24/7
- Books directly into Cliniko

Our clients see an average 30% cost reduction with 3x ROI.

Reignite Health is now handling 877 patients across 10 villages with this system. Full case study with the numbers: https://yesai.au/case-studies/reignite-health

### Email 8: The "Natural Voice" Email (Objection handling)

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "No, it doesn't sound like a robot"
- B: "The #1 thing people ask about AI receptionists"
- C: "Would your patients even notice?"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

"Does it sound robotic?"

That's the first question everyone asks about AI phone systems. Fair question - we've all dealt with terrible phone trees.

So here's the honest answer: Most patients don't realise they're talking to AI.

It's not because we're hiding it - it's because the technology has gotten that good. The AI:
- Uses natural pauses and "um" sounds
- Responds to interruptions naturally
- Handles accents and unclear speech
- Adapts tone to match the caller

Reignite Health serves aged care residents (average age 75+). Their feedback? Patients find it easy to use and often don't notice the difference.

Don't take my word for it - hear it yourself:

https://cal.com/p-b-ttzvpm/15min

I'll play you real call recordings and you can judge if it would work for your patients.

### Email 9: The Competitor Comparison Email

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "Why most 'AI receptionist' products fail practices"
- B: "The difference between message-taking and actual booking"
- C: "Not all AI reception is created equal"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick rant: Most "AI receptionist" products just take messages.

They answer the phone, collect a name and number, and email you. That's... not reception. That's voicemail with extra steps.

Here's what actual AI reception looks like:

Patient: "Hi, I'd like to book a physio appointment for next week"
AI: "Of course. I can see Dr Sarah has availability Tuesday at 10am or Thursday at 2pm. Which works better for you?"
Patient: "Tuesday's good"
AI: "Perfect. I've booked you in for Tuesday at 10am with Dr Sarah. You'll receive a confirmation SMS shortly. Is there anything else I can help with?"

That booking is now in Cliniko. With notes. Ready to go.

That's what we built for Reignite Health - 80+ features, full Cliniko integration, handles all Australian funding types.

### Email 10: The Final/Break-up Email

**Subject Lines:**
- A: "Closing the loop on AI reception"
- B: "Last email from me"
- C: "Just checking before I close your file"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I've sent a few emails about our AI receptionist for Cliniko practices and haven't heard back - which is totally fine.

I don't want to keep bothering you, so this will be my last email.

If AI phone reception isn't the right fit for [Practice Name] right now, I completely understand. Healthcare is busy and there are a million priorities.

But if it ever becomes relevant - maybe you're hiring a receptionist and wondering about alternatives, or you're frustrated with after-hours voicemails - the offer stands:

15-minute demo: https://cal.com/p-b-ttzvpm/15min
Case study: https://yesai.au/case-studies/reignite-health

Either way, I wish you and the team all the best.

## OBJECTION HANDLING

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have enough staff" | "That's great! The AI handles overflow and after-hours, so your staff can focus on patients in the practice." |
| "AI won't handle complex calls" | "You're right - it's not for clinical queries. It handles routine bookings and escalates anything complex to your team." |
| "Our patients are older, they won't like AI" | "Actually, our main client Reignite Health serves aged care residents. The AI speaks naturally and patients often don't realise it's AI." |
| "We don't use Cliniko" | "No problem - we integrate with other systems too. What do you currently use?" |
| "Too expensive" | "Pricing starts under $1/hour equivalent. Our clients see 30% cost reduction on average. Happy to run the numbers on a quick call?" |
| "We tried an AI before and it was terrible" | "Most 'AI receptionists' just take messages. Ours actually books appointments in real-time. Worth 15 minutes to see the difference?" |
| "Our reception is fine" | "That's good to hear. Most practices find the AI useful for after-hours and overflow - freeing up your receptionist for in-person patients." |
