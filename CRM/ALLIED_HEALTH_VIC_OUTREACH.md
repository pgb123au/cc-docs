## EMAIL TEMPLATES

### Email 1: The Problem/Solution Hook (Cold Outreach)

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: "Your receptionist called in sick - now what?"
- B: "The call you missed at 5:47pm yesterday"
- C: "[Practice Name] - quick question about your phones"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: what happens to the calls that come in when your team is busy with patients, at lunch, or after 5pm?

For most allied health practices, the honest answer is... they go to voicemail. And voicemails often mean lost bookings.

We've just helped Reignite Health (allied health provider across 10 aged care villages in NSW) solve this with an AI receptionist that:

• Answers every call 24/7 in a natural voice
• Books directly into Cliniko in real-time
• Handles DVA, HCP, Medicare & NDIS funding queries
• Speaks 30+ languages for diverse patient bases

The result? No more missed calls. No more voicemail phone tag. Appointments just appear in Cliniko.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this could work for [Practice Name]? No pitch, just a quick demo so you can hear it yourself.

Book a time that suits: https://cal.com/p-b-ttzvpm/15min

### Email 2: The Case Study Email (Follow-up or warm lead)

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- A: "How 877 patients now book appointments without waiting on hold"
- B: "Allied health practice cuts phone admin by 70%"
- C: "Case study: AI receptionist for Cliniko practices"

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I wanted to share something that might be relevant for [Practice Name].

We recently completed an AI voice receptionist implementation for Reignite Health, an allied health provider serving aged care residents across Victoria and NSW.

The challenge:
- High call volume overwhelming reception
- Multiple funding types (DVA, HCP, Medicare, NDIS, private)
- Calls going to voicemail after hours and during peak times
- Staff spending hours on routine booking calls

The solution:
An AI receptionist that integrates directly with Cliniko to answer calls 24/7, check real-time availability, and create bookings with all the correct appointment notes.

Key stats:
✓ 10 villages served
✓ 877+ patients in the system
✓ 26 different service types
✓ 80+ features built into the AI

The AI handles everything from "I'd like to book a physio appointment" to "I'm a DVA patient, my claim number is..."—and the booking appears in Cliniko with all details attached.

Worth a 15-minute look?

I'd be happy to show you how it sounds and answer any questions. No obligation, just a quick demo.

## OBJECTION HANDLING

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have enough staff" | "That's great! The AI handles overflow and after-hours, so your staff can focus on patients in the practice." |
| "AI won't handle complex calls" | "You're right - it's not for clinical queries. It handles routine bookings and escalates anything complex to your team." |
| "Our patients are older, they won't like AI" | "Actually, our main client Reignite Health serves aged care residents. The AI speaks naturally and patients often don't realise it's AI." |
| "We don't use Cliniko" | "No problem - we integrate with other systems too. What do you currently use?" |
| "Too expensive" | "Pricing starts under $1/hour equivalent. Happy to run the numbers on a quick call?" |
